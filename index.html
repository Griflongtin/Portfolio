            <h5>My name is Griffin Longtin</h5>
            <p>I am a very active person. I am a <strong>Boy Scout</strong>, Have been my entire life. Was elected by troop members to plan, staff, and manage all troop activities for a very active troop, including 6 meetings and at least one major weekend event per month.  Had the best time of my life doing this job. After that I was elected in the Order of the Arrow, National Honor Society for the <strong>Boy Scouts</strong> of America. Troops elect members to this post based on how well the member represents the values embodied by scouting.  Order of the Arrow members provide service support to non-profits, other public service organizations, and BSA troops. I have held a couple of position in the Order of the Arrow, but mainly I staff at <strong>Boy Scout</strong> Camps. I successfully managed staff activities and parent activities of fast-paced one-week camping sessions at Oregonâ€™s Premiere BSA camp on the Oregon Coast. Taught scouting skills (such as rocketry, robotics, fire safety, cooking, and others) to groups of campers. Did lots of maintenance to old building and shakes.</p>

            <p>Robotics is something I love to do. I was on a robotics team, Each year we use to participated in a community team in a worldwide competition (locally administered by Oregon State University) designed to promote learning in science, technology, engineering and mathematics.  Learned basics of the engineering and project management.  Beyond the competition season our team continued year-round meetings focusing on learning computer programming (Java, Python, RobotC).</p>
            <p>I am great at working with people, and experienced at it from years as a <strong>Boy scout</strong> camp counselor and camp commissioner.  Home schooled, recently graduated. Good work ethic, experience at group leadership as well as membership.  Knowledgeable and experienced with computers and Microsoft office programs.  Experience with the safe use of tools, operation of machinery up to and including bulldozers, and OSHA safe work practices.</p>
